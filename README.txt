SQL Learning Site (No build tools needed)

How to use:
1) Open index.html in Chrome (double click the file).
2) The app loads sql.js from a CDN and runs SQLite in your browser.
3) Pick a lesson from the left, write SQL in the editor, and click Run.
4) Use Reset DB to restore the starter dataset.

Notes:
- Progress is saved in your browser (localStorage).
- If your network blocks CDNs, allow https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ so the WebAssembly file can load.
- This is SQLite syntax. MySQL/PostgreSQL date functions differ slightly.
